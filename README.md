This repo is a demonstration of my understanding of quantum computation, and [Qsikit](https://qiskit.org/) in particular.
The long term plan for this repo is:
1. Some Quantum Physics Revision
2. Implementation of Important Quantum Algorithms
3. Run some of the algorithms on an actual quantum computer
	- Learn some technique for dealing with real-world conditions
4. Learn Some Advanced features
	- For example Pulses and other time features.
